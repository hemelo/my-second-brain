- 🌐 Designed for cross-platform, high-performance apps.
- Supports ASP.NET Core, Microservices, Console Apps.
- Fully open source and modular.
- Final version is **3.1**, replaced by .NET 5+.

### 📖 **.NET 5, 6, 7, 8+ (Unified .NET)**

- 🚀 Modern, unified platform that replaces both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

## 📋 **When to Use Which?**

|Scenario|Recommended Framework|
|---|---|
|Legacy Desktop App|.NET Framework|
|New Cross-Platform API|.NET 6 / .NET 8|
|High-Performance Web API|.NET 6 / .NET 8|
|Windows-Only Desktop (WPF/WinForms)|.NET 6+|
|Microservices / Containers|.NET 6+|

> 📌 **Note:** New development should target .NET 6 or .NET 8. .NET Framework is only for maintaining existing legacy apps.

---

## 🚀 **Conclusion**

- ✅ **.NET Framework**: For maintaining legacy Windows applications.
    
- ✅ **.NET Core**: Introduced cross-platform, but now superseded.
    
- ✅ **.NET 5+ (Unified)**: The future of .NET—use this for all new development.
    

If you’re starting a new project, always prefer **.NET 6 LTS or .NET 8 LTS** to ensure long-term support and access to modern features.
