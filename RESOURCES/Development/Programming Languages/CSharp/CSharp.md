## ðŸ“– **Overview**

C# is a modern, versatile, and object-oriented programming language designed by **Microsoft** in 2000. It is widely recognized for its clean syntax, strong type system, and powerful language features that encourage writing safe, maintainable, and high-performance code. C# continues to evolve with every version, introducing cutting-edge programming concepts and productivity enhancements.

C# is intended to be a **simple**, **modern**, **general-purpose**, and **object-oriented** language. It promotes software engineering principles such as:

- Strong type checking
- Array bounds checking
- Detection of uninitialized variables
- Automatic garbage collection
    

The language focuses on **software robustness**, **durability**, and **programmer productivity**, making it suitable for developing components in distributed environments. Source code portability and programmer portabilityâ€”especially for those familiar with **C** and **C++**â€”are also primary considerations.

C# supports both **hosted** and **embedded systems**, ranging from large-scale systems running sophisticated operating systems to small devices with dedicated functions. Although it strives for efficiency in memory and processing power, it is **not intended to compete directly** with lower-level languages like **C** or **assembly** in terms of performance and size.

Although C# primarily runs within the **[[DotNet|.NET]] ecosystem**, which provides runtime and libraries, this document focuses strictly on the language features and its evolution.
