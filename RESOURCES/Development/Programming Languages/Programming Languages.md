## 📝 **Introduction**

Programming languages are formal systems composed of syntax and semantics that define how instructions are written and executed by computers. They serve as a critical bridge between human logic and machine operations, enabling the creation of software, automation of tasks, control of hardware devices, and processing of vast data sets.

These languages can follow various paradigms such as:

- **Imperative**: Focus on how tasks are performed (e.g., C, Go)
- **Declarative**: Focus on what outcome is desired (e.g., SQL, HTML)
- **Object-Oriented**: Organize code into reusable objects (e.g., Java, C#)
- **Functional**: Treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions (e.g., Haskell, F#)

Each language is designed with specific goals in mind—some excel at system-level programming, others at data science or web development. Understanding their characteristics helps developers select the right tool for each project.
