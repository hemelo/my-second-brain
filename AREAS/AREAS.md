- Roles or Responsibilities
- Ongoing maintenance
- Never completed
- This is the first A from [[PARA Notes]]

>[!INFO]
>Areas are **the personal** bucket of your life for important things that don't have an end date. You won't ever "stop" working on your health; for example, it's a constant ongoing thing.
>- While areas can (and often do) generate projects, they are not linked since it's already intuitive which areas a project comes from, so there's no need to create an explicit link between, for example, the "Server maintenance" project and the "Sysadmin" area.
>  - Finally, because they are personal, areas contain information you wrote for _yourself only_ about those areas in your life. Which is opposite to 3. Resources.
